# Mixed Reality Wisdom Community Project - Telepresence Robot Landing Page

Welcome to the Mixed Reality Wisdom Community Project (WisComm). Thank you for your participation in this study, in this webpage you will be able to find links allowing you to control the Double3 Telepresence robots which have been supplied. 
Do be aware, each robot can only be connected to by one individual at a time. If the link to a robot fails to load, it is likely that this robot is already in use and you will need to select a different robot to control.
